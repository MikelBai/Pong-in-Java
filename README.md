# pong
Pong using the Processing library.
I think you might have to download Processing before you can run this.

Spiced it up from regular Pong mildly with blocks in the middle as obstacles.
Spiced it up buggily with attempts at angling the ball according to where it hit the paddle.

Ball sometimes goes through paddle. 
Ball sometimes goes through obstacles.
Ball sometimes angles wrong.

Unsure of where exactly I went wrong, but I kinda like it like this.
